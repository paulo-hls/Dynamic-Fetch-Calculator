# Dynamic Fetch Calculator

# About The Project
The dynamic fetch calculator is a tool responsible for including, in the modeling of emissions from liquid surfaces, the wind direction. Thus, it is possible to calculate the fetch with greater precision.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
* It's advised that the user utilize the code in softwares that allow you to execute interactively

## Usage
The user need to set some variables into the code, such as:
* Path of the KML file of the surface (in cases of surfaces defined in Google EarthÂ®)
* Vertices of the surface (in cases of mathematically defined surfaces)
* Number of intervals that the original surface will be divided
* Path to the weather data (containing direction and speed of the wind)
* Values of z0 and Scl
* Path to the final save of the results
